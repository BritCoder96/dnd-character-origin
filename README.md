D&amp;D character image creator/sharer, generated from just your character sheet!


To run, run python3 app.py in a terminal and go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/. You'll have to install a bunch of stuff (most of these via pip3) including:
python3-venv, python3, flask, pytesseract, opencv-python, tesseract itself, and some other stuff. Follow the errors when trying to run the server. Of note, it looks like pip3 broke a few days ago but was fixed: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63410588/cant-install-opencv-python3-8 if you get this error upgrade pip3: sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
